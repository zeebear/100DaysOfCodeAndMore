Started by getting it running in localhost, which involved figuring out which API keys to use for Cloudinary and MapBox (mine, and Mati's, respectively).

Then I moved on to getting it running on Heroku. Seeding wouldn't work until I figured out what problem it was having with Algolia -- it needs the "Search-Only API Key" for the algoliasearch.js file, but the "Admin API Key" to create the index. I made two new environmental variables to store the admin key and the application ID, and used those in the algoliasearch.rb file. Also, the parameter for the index variable in the algoliasearch.js file was set incorrectly -- the name of the index is the same as the class, unless specified otherwise (cf. [algoliasearch-rails](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-rails#custom-index-name)). The search still doesn't seem to be working, though maybe I just didn't give it enough time to create the index? Will continue on that tomorrow. [This](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-rails#custom-index-name) is probably relevant.

I also haven't given the app a test run on Heroku yet to see what will break -- that must happen tomorrow!

Time spent coding: I lost track, but it was more than three hours for sure.
