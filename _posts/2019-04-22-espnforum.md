Project image found [here](http://boldlist.net/top-5-Reddit-alternatives.php) -- if I shouldn't be using it, please let me know!

From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 5.

I must go back and look at how the comments are shown on the messages page -- that and the user authentication are the key differences with the previous apps.
