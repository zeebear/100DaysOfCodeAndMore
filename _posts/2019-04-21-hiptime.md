From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 4.

It's supposed to be an "Todoist clone" -- you can log in, create tasks, mark them as completed. I haven't pushed it to Heroku -- since I'm on the free plan for now, I've decided for the moment to only put apps there where I've been heavily involved in their creation. Instafoto will probably stay there for now, because I changed how the photos are uploaded, but I'll take down Tumblifi when I need the space.

### What I learned from this:
Given my beginner status I'm not entirely sure, but I think the way he links the two tables doesn't work -- at least, it didn't for me! I had to delete the migration I made while following the video and do it again using `:references` -- then it worked, with a bit of tweaking.
