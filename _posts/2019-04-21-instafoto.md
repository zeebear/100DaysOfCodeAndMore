From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 3. 

It's supposed to be an "Instagram clone" -- you can log in and post pictures that other users can comment on. I prefer the look of the "older" 3-column layout, so I've stuck with this for now.

### What I learned from this:
Back to Haml. I was having errors with both the CSS and the JavaScript that turned out to be Haml indentation errors -- that took me a while to discover! I initially assumed the JavaScript problems were because it's my first time doing anything with CoffeeScript, and I thought the CSS might not work because I was using a newer gem than he was, but they both turned out to be simple indentation errors.

I also used Cloudinary and Carrierwave to upload the images, since the gem he used is now deprecated. Cloudinary didn't pick up on the link in the .env file, and I still have no idea why! Eventually solved that by including the .yaml file, following their instructions, and it worked like a charm, including on Heroku. Must remember to change that on Heroku and see if it still worksâ€¦ Also, there was a problem with an "uninitialized constant" in PhotoUploader that mysteriously fixed itself -- see the blog post for 17 April.
