progress: Fixed all the bugs so now Cowork Rental runs as well as it ever did
thoughts: There's a list of stuff that I could improve below the fold, but for now I'm moving on to the next project!

### Things that could be improved at a later time:
* The search in the navbar works for terms like "private" or "shared", but not for addresses or "wifi", e.g.
* In the office show for offices without an image, the text shows up on top of the image area instead of below it. It's not terrible, but it's not how it's supposed to work
* You can't delete an office yet
* You can't see if your booking has been approved or rejected by the owner

### How I'm counting the days here:
* A day gets counted only if I've had my fingers on the keyboard for at least an hour on that day
* Only reading, or flashcards, or listening to a podcast or video, don't count

### Where the last four days went:
* Lots of concerts!
* Did flashcards, did some reading, but no coding, so no days logged
