From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 6.

I had to do a bit of digging on my own to figure out where to put everything to get the stars working, but I managed it eventually.

This was a very useful app to build -- plenty to revisit later!
