progress: Pushed to Heroku and seems to be working first try!
thoughts: Most of the issues were problems with Haml indentation. Didn't have time to fully check Heroku app, but looks OK

### Cloudinary solved by including Yaml file
I stuck the yaml file in and it worked like a charm. I still have no idea why it wasn't picking up the link from the .env fileâ€¦
