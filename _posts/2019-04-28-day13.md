From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 6.

I coded for about an hour and a half today. I put in cloudinary and carrierwave in about half an hour, spent another twenty minutes finishing the videos about images, and the last forty minutes zapping bugs, until I decided to stop for the night. So far I've fixed little bugs that cropped up becuase of me doing the associations differently than shown in the video (using :references) -- I decided to fix the migrations so that instead of "user_id_id" it's just "user_id" now, and ditto for "category_id". I also added the categories creation to the seed file, so I can quickly update those if I need to, and can seed every time I have to drop, create, and migrate ;-)

When I stopped for the night I was getting a strange error related to the simple_form for "play" creation -- "undefined method `photo_cache' for #<Play:0x00007faafbe17dc0>". Never saw that one before! Not sure why it thinks 'photo_cache' should be a methodâ€¦will look at that tomorrow.
