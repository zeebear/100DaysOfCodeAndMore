progress: Was going fine until Cloudinary!
thoughts: The method used in the tutorial to upload photos is deprecated, so I'm trying to make it work with Cloudinary

I have *absolutely no* idea why it's not working with Cloudinary. Everything's where it should be according to the setup that's worked for me in previous apps, but somehow it's not providing the API key when it comes to uploading the photo? I had to dare to use the "rm -r" command to get rid of all the temp folders that were building up in the temp folder in the uploads folder public folder D:

### Errors being thrown:
- CloudinaryException (Must supply api_key)
- uninitialized constant PhotoUploader

I had a look at [Causes of Ruby NameError: Uninitialized Constant Error](https://www.thoughtco.com/nameerror-uninitialized-2907928) -- none of them helped in my case.

Tried a few fixes from [here](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/399) -- probably something did the trick, because it's not giving the uninitialized constant error any more. Maybe [this](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/399#issuecomment-6688635) but could have been [this](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/399#issuecomment-51422423). No clue.
