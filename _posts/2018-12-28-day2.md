Since this is just a normal Jekyll post you can add to what you have written in **progress** and **thoughts**. The reason why you might want this, is because you might be working on something hard and you want to keep track of more things that a two line sentence doesn't allow for.

The good thing about this, is that you can use it as a simple way to take notes about what you have worked on or learned.
