thoughts: It's a todoist-inspired app

I've decided that since I'm on Heroku's free plan, for the moment I'll only put apps there where I've been heavily involved in their creation. Instafoto will probably stay there for now, for example, because I changed how the photos are uploaded, but I'll take down Tumblifi when I need the space.

This app wasn't terribly exciting -- another two-model app. I'm starting to try to do things before he shows us how, which is good practice I guess. I'll push on and do the 8 apps -- Udemy says I've 57% completed -- and then I may or may not try to recreate them from scratch for more practice. The last app looks like it might be a good one to recreate -- TaskRabbit looks quite similar my so-called "business idea", hahaha.
