From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 1. 

It's supposed to be an "Evernote Lookalike" -- you can log in and see notes (plain text only) that you've stored. There are so many ways I could spice this up, but that's for laterâ€¦

### What I learned from this:
A good (if somewhat slow for me) revision of how to make a Ruby app. And Haml! That was totally new to me, and seems fast enough to pick up (we'll see how I feel about that when I have to do it all from scratch!)
