From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 6.

I'm about halfway through the tutorial -- I got to video # 100, and Udemy says I'm 75% of the way through the course. This app has some new and interesting features compared to the earlier apps -- it has filtering, and will have stars, and it has three models so far. It is interesting to see where the new 'complications' slot into the basic model ðŸ¤“

I'm stopping here for today because I have a headache and can't focus well enough to add images -- he's going to use the Paperclip gem again, so I'll once again try to get Cloudinary and Carrierwave working instead, but I simply don't have the brainpower today.
