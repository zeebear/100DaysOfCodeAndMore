From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 2. 

It's supposed to be a "hybrid of Tumblr and a personal website" -- you can log in and post blog posts that people can comment on, but also post personal information. The CSS is still ugly -- I'll go back and polish it a bit when I've finished the other tutorials in this series.

### What I learned from this:
Back to Erb. I find that with Sublime Text's autocomplete helpers it's as fast to write Erb as Haml. I do have to confess that Haml wins hands down for ease of readingâ€¦
