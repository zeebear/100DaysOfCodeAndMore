From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 6.

At the start of my programming session I managed to debug what I had done until then -- my way of joining the tables means I had to tweak some stuff in the controller (why is the category_id a string when it's returned from the params?! weird…) Then I noticed that I hadn't changed the database and was using Sqlite. I changed it to PostgreSQL just for practice. Then I followed the videos for adding reviews, once again trying to complete the steps myself before looking at the video, and joining the reviews table using :references instead of his way. I don't understand why he's not using :references -- maybe it didn't exist when the videos were made? (I think I remember seeing that they're from 2015/2016?) I mean, the associations are there -- it's not like you avoid creating an instance of User…

Coded for about two hours today.
