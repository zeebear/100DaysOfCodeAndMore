Having decided, after a bit of thinking and research over the last few days, where and how to host the site, I sat down to see how much I had forgotten. I was pleasantly surprised that it was up and running in a little over an hour and a half. It's just a business card, but it's responsive, and I _think_ I've gotten the image where I want it (though I haven't tested it on many browsers / mobiles).

This will be hosted on GitHub pages, and I'll probably use Cloudflare for it just to see how that works. Currently waiting for replies about the domain name before moving it to its "forever" home.
