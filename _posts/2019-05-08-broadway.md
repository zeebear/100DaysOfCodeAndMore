Project image found [here](https://static.broadway.com/img/logos/bwy-com-trans_logo-448x124.f23c3b57a30a.png) -- if I shouldn't be using it, please let me know!

From Yonathan Ayenew's [8 Beautiful Ruby on Rails Apps in 30 Days & TDD - Immersive](https://www.udemy.com/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/) -- Project 6.

I've changed quite a few things in this project. PostgreSQL for the database. Cloudinary and Carrierwave for photo uploading. I had to do a bit of digging on my own to figure out where to put everything to get the stars working, but I managed it eventually, thanks especially to [this page](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-javascript-include-external.html).

This was a very useful app to build -- plenty to revisit later! This app has some new and interesting features compared to the earlier apps -- it has **filtering**, and **stars**, and it has **three models**, including **reviews**.
